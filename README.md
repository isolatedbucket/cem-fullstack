# Campus Event Management System

## Project Overview
The Campus Event Management System is a web application designed to manage and display events within a university or educational institution. The system allows users to view a list of upcoming events, along with key information such as the event's name, date, time, location, and description. Administrators can create new events, making the platform useful for both event organizers and attendees. 

This project is developed using a **React** frontend and an **Express** backend connected to **MongoDB**, providing a full-stack solution for event management.
